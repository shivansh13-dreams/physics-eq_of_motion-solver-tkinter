# PHYSICS PROBLEM SOLVER USING EQUATIONS OF MOTION

WHAT IT DOES:
 1) IT USES PYTHON AND THE TKINTER LIBRARY INSIDE PYTHON.
 2) TWO FILES ARE THERE, ONE WITH THE SOLVER LOGIC AND OTHER WITH TKINTER DISPLAY.
 3) IT TAKES 5 VARIABLES, INITIAL VELOCITY(u), FINAL VELOCITY(v), DISPLACEMENT(s), TIME(t) AND ACCELERATION(a).
 4) IT USES THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION TO CALCULATE THESE VARIABLES.
 5) A MINIMUM OF THREE VARIABLES MUST BE PROVIDED TO CALCULATE ALL THE FIVE.
 6) IT DOES NOT USE ADVANCED KINEMATICS CURRENTLY.
 7) IT HAS SOME GOOD DARK-MODE DISPLAY.

HOW TO USE:
  - YOU CAN COPY-PASTE AND RUN IT LOCALLY TO TEST IT.
  - YOU ARE FREE TO RECCOMMEND SUGGESTIONS AND GIVE FEEDBACK.
    
NOTE : IT IS ONLY A BASIC SOLVER FOR SIMPLE CALCULATIONS AND STUFF.

ABOUT ME:
 I AM SHIVANSH, 13 FROM INDIA. THIS IS THE 1st MEANINGFUL PROJECT THAT I HAVE BUILT. AS OF NOW, I KNOW PYTHON, HTML AND A BIT OF JavaScript. I KNOW IT MIGHT NOT BE 
 REALLY GREAT BUT HEY, IT IS MY FIRST PROJECT. I WILL BE ADDING NEW FEATURES AND KEEP IMPROVING IT.

FEAUTES I AM PLANNING TO ADD:
 1) AI TO PARSE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE INPUT.
 2) MORE PHYSICS-EQUATIONS FOR VERSATALITY.

HELP ME IMPROVE IT BY RECCOMMENDING NEW FEATURES AND SUGGESTIONS. I WILL BE HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR FEEDBACK.
HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.
